# Movie Website

This code can be used to demonstrate the use of classes within python. 
It does so by creating instances of your favourite movies using the same instance variables and classes. The different instances are then used to generate a movie website of your movie instances.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need python 2.7 to run this code.


### Installing

Python can be installed from the python default website. 


## Running the tests

To run the code, provide the information to your favourite movie to a new instance.


toy_story = media.Movie("Toy Story",
                        "A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room",
                        "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDU2ZWJlMjktMTRhMy00ZTA5LWEzNDgtYmNmZTEwZTViZWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDQ2OTk4MzI@._V1_UX182_CR0,0,182,268_AL_.jpg",
                        "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYz2wyBy3kc",
                        81)#movie instance made for Toy Story.

 Instance_name = media.Movie("Movie name", "Movie discription", 								"Poster image url", "movie youtube 									trailer url", movie duration)
